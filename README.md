# Hand-Controlled Drone Simulation with ORB-SLAM3

## Description
A computer vision project that uses webcam-based hand tracking to simulate drone movement, and uses ORB-SLAM3 to build a real-time map of the environment based on camera input.

## Structure
- `hand_tracking/`: Hand gesture recognition using MediaPipe.
- `drone_simulation/`: Virtual drone follows the hand.
- `video_recording/`: Records video for SLAM.
- `slam_input/`: Prepares/feeds video into ORB-SLAM3.
- `orb_slam3/`: Configuration and run commands.
- `videos/`: Saved input videos.
- `results/`: Output maps and trajectory files.
